Suppose
    \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \)
    is a~\( N\times N \)~matrix
    consisting of \( M \) zeroes and \( N^2 - M \) ones.
Considered an adjacency matrix this matrix \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \)
    defines a graph that is complete except for \( M \) ``removed'' edges.
Some important properties of a graph are related to the spectrum
    of its adjacency matrix.
E.g. Wang~\cite{epidemic} investigates asymptotic behavior
    of a network viral spread model
    when cure and infection probabilities are fixed for each node.
In this work it is shown that the location of the ratio
    of the cure and the infection probabilities
    belove or above a certain treshold value
    determines whether the contamination will take the epidemic form
    or fade.
Spectral theory of graphs and its applications are described in detail
    in the treatise ``Spectra of Graphs'' by Cvetkovic~et~al.~\cite{cvet}.

So let's examine spectral properties of this matrix.
First of all \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \) can be represented as
\[ \mathscr{A}_{MN} = \mathcal{J}_N - \mathscr{B}_{MN} =
    \begin{pmatrix}1 & \cdots & 1\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & \cdots & 1\end{pmatrix} - \mathscr{B}_{MN}, \]
    where \( \mathcal{J}_N \) is an all-ones \( N\times N \) matrix
    and \( \mathscr{B}_{MN} \) has unities exactly at these \( M \) places,
    at which \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \) has zeros.

The spectrum \( \sigma\left( \mathcal{J}_N \right) \)
 of \( \mathcal{J}_N \) can be easily calculated:
 \( \mathcal{J}_N^2 = N \mathcal{J}_N, \) hence
 \( \lambda(\lambda - N) \) is the minimal annihilating polynomial of \( \mathcal{J}_N \),
 and consequently
 \( \sigma\left( \mathcal{J}_N \right) = \left\{ 0,N \right\}. \)

Be \( M \) small enough
    the eigenvalues of \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \) will be close to those of \( \mathcal{J}_N \).
Applying the method of similar operators (см.~\cite{baskakov-harmonic,baskakov-split})
    we prove the following theorem:
\begin{thm}\label{kozlukovsv:thm:almost-all-ones}
    Let \( M < \frac{N^2}{16} \),
    then \( \mathscr{A}_{MN} \) can be represented as disjoint union
    \( \sigma\left(\mathscr{A}_{MN}\right) = \sigma_1 \cup \sigma_2 \)
    of a singleton \( \sigma_1=\{\lambda_1\} \)
    and the set \( \sigma_2 \) which satisfy the following restrictions:
    \[ \sigma_1 \subset \left\{ \mu\in\mathbb{R}; \lvert \mu - N \rvert < 4\sqrt{M} \right\}, \]
    \[ \sigma_2 \subset \left\{ \mu\in\mathbb{C}; \lvert \mu \rvert < 4\sqrt{M} \right\}. \]
\end{thm}
